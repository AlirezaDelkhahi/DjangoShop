```
then activate the virtual env

source venv/bin/activate
```
then try to install requirements of project.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

after installing requirements you have to go to the sweetify directory in venv/lib/sweetify and edit encoder.py file: find and change "force_text" to "force_str"
